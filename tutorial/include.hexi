# The 'include' keyword lets us import the contents of other files
# It functions similarly to the preprocessor #include in C,
# in that it just copies the contents into this file.

# 'include' will first check the current directory
# If it can't find the file there,
# it will attempt to check in PATH

# Syntax include "[FILENAME]"
